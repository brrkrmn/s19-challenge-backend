## Twitter Clone

This repo is the backend part of a Twitter clone project. It is built with Spring Boot, using Spring Security for authentication, Hibernate (JPA) for ORM, and a PostgreSQL database.
The API supports user registration, login with Basic Auth, tweet creation, commenting, liking, following users, and more.

Authentication is implemented with Basic Auth, and passwords are stored using a BCrypt password encoder. The backend exposes a RESTful API consumed by the frontend project.
